# The kween board

cool split keyboard.

## Compiling

```
  arduino-cli compile -ub rp2040:rp2040:waveshare_rp2040_pizero -p /dev/ttyACM0
```


## Notes

- juice key vs bigger space and alt (right side)
  - I had space for one key, but maybe I should just have 1.5u space and alt. Currently, that 1u space looks stupid and I'm also not using it that much... (I guess I just don't use the rspace...) Would I start using it after I enlarge it?
- juice key toggle MOUSE MODE
  - just an idea
  - either hjkl steering mouse OR jk for scroll and some other place for dat mouse.
  - move mouse with keys.
  - clicking and scrolling obv.
